# Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms

This library allows for quick and easy benchmarking of a host of machine learning algorithms for supervised learning on general datasets. 

Before you get into feature generation, extraction, or normalization, you can run this Python-based command line tool on your data to understand which algorithms give you the best initial performance. If you get similar performance from multiple algorithms, add noisy features and/or Gaussian noise to your features to check for tolerance to overfitting.

Works for both classification and regression problems. Examples on classical datasets (e.g. iris) are included.
